# RGTAN Implementation Improvements

This document summarizes the improvements made to the RGTAN codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Typo (High Priority)
- **File**: `main.py`, `methods/rgtan/rgtan_main.py`
- **Change**: Renamed `loda_rgtan_data` to `load_rgtan_data`
- **Impact**: Improves code readability and consistency

### 2. Created Shared Transformer Module (High Priority)
- **File**: `methods/common/transformer_conv.py` (new)
- **Change**: Extracted the duplicated `TransformerConv` class into a shared module
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `methods/gtan/gtan_model.py`
  - `methods/rgtan/rgtan_model.py`
- **Impact**: Eliminates code duplication, improves maintainability

### 3. Improved Error Handling (High Priority)
- **File**: `methods/rgtan/rgtan_main.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced bare `except:` blocks with specific exception handling
  - Added informative error messages
  - Now catches `ValueError` for metric calculations and `FileNotFoundError` for data loading
- **Impact**: Better debugging and error tracking

### 4. Moved Hardcoded Configurations (Medium Priority)
- **File**: `config/rgtan_cfg.yaml`
- **Added Configurations**:
  - `lr_scheduler`: Learning rate scheduler settings
  - `max_training_epochs`: Maximum training epochs
  - `conv_heads`: Convolution heads per layer
- **Files Updated**: `methods/rgtan/rgtan_main.py`
- **Impact**: Improved flexibility and configuration management

### 5. Added Comprehensive Documentation (Medium Priority)
- **Files Updated**:
  - `methods/rgtan/rgtan_main.py`: Added docstrings for `rgtan_main()` and `load_rgtan_data()`
  - `methods/rgtan/rgtan_model.py`: Added docstrings for `RGTAN`, `TransEmbedding`, and `forward()` methods
  - `methods/common/transformer_conv.py`: Added comprehensive docstrings
  - `methods/rgtan/rgtan_lpa.py`: Enhanced `load_lpa_subtensor()` documentation
- **Impact**: Better code understanding and maintainability

### 6. Optimized Memory Usage (Medium Priority)
- **File**: `methods/rgtan/rgtan_lpa.py`
- **Change**: Replaced `copy.deepcopy()` with `tensor.clone()` for label propagation
- **Impact**: Reduced memory consumption during training

## Summary of Key Improvements

1. **Code Quality**: Fixed naming conventions, improved error handling, and added comprehensive documentation
2. **Maintainability**: Eliminated code duplication by creating shared modules
3. **Flexibility**: Moved hardcoded values to configuration files
4. **Performance**: Optimized memory usage in data loading
5. **Robustness**: Added specific exception handling instead of silent failures

## New Features Added

### 7. Credit Card Dataset Integration
- **Files Modified**:
  - `methods/rgtan/rgtan_main.py`: Added creditcard dataset support in `load_rgtan_data()`
  - `main.py`: Added command-line support for creditcard dataset
- **Files Created**:
  - `config/creditcard_cfg.yaml`: Configuration for creditcard dataset
  - `test_creditcard.py`: Test script for dataset loading
  - `feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py`: Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline
- **Implementation Details**:
  - Graph construction based on shared entities (card_number, member_id, IP, email, BIN)
  - Time-based train/test split (70/30)
  - Datetime feature engineering (seconds since first transaction)
  - Support for both numerical and categorical features
  - Handles missing values appropriately

### 8. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline
- **File**: `feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py`
- **Features**:
  - **Privacy Protection**: Hashes sensitive data (card numbers, emails, IPs)
  - **Temporal Features**: Extracts hour, day of week, time since first transaction
  - **Velocity Features**: Time between transactions for same card/user
  - **Aggregated Risk Features**: Historical fraud rates, transaction counts per entity
  - **Neighborhood Features**: 1-hop and 2-hop fraud statistics
  - **Graph Construction**: Efficient adjacency list creation with configurable edge frequency
- **Outputs**:
  - `creditcard_preprocessed.csv`: Main dataset with engineered features
  - `creditcard_homo_adjlists.pickle`: Pre-computed adjacency lists
  - `creditcard_neigh_feat.csv`: Neighborhood risk statistics
  - `creditcard_preprocessing_metadata.pickle`: Preprocessing configuration

## Usage Instructions

### Running RGTAN with Credit Card Dataset

```bash
# Step 1: Preprocess the data (recommended)
python feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py \
    --input data/vod_creditcard.csv \
    --output data/ \
    --min-edge-freq 2

# Step 2: Run RGTAN with preprocessed data
python main.py --method rgtan --creditcard

# Alternative: Test the dataset loading
python test_creditcard.py

# Alternative: Run without preprocessing (basic features only)
python main.py --method rgtan --creditcard
```

### Preprocessing Options

```bash
# Full preprocessing with privacy protection
python feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py

# Without privacy (keeps original card numbers, emails, etc.)
python feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py --no-privacy

# Custom edge frequency threshold
python feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py --min-edge-freq 5
```

### Graph Construction Details
- Nodes: Each transaction is a node
- Edges: Transactions are connected if they share:
  - Same card number
  - Same member ID
  - Same customer IP
  - Same customer email
  - Same BIN (Bank Identification Number)

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Unit Tests**: Add comprehensive unit tests for all components
2. **Type Hints**: Add type annotations throughout the codebase
3. **Logging**: Replace print statements with proper logging
4. **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration and testing
5. **Performance Profiling**: Profile the code to identify further optimization opportunities
6. **Documentation**: Create API documentation and usage examples
7. **Neighborhood Features**: Generate neighborhood risk statistics for creditcard dataset
8. **Class Imbalance**: Implement weighted loss functions for fraud detection
9. **Edge Pruning**: Add configurable edge pruning based on frequency thresholds
