# Credit Card Dataset Integration - Summary of Fixes

## The Problem
RGTAN was expecting categorical features (like 'trans_status_msg_id') to be available in the feature dataframe, but when using preprocessed data:
1. These columns are already encoded (e.g., 'trans_status_msg_id_encoded')
2. The original categorical columns are not included in feat_data
3. RGTAN's embedding layer was trying to access non-existent columns

## The Solution
For the creditcard dataset with preprocessed data:
1. **Set cat_features to empty list** - Since categorical features are already encoded in the preprocessing step, we don't need separate categorical embeddings
2. **Include encoded features in feat_data** - The encoded categorical features are included as regular numerical features
3. **Skip categorical embedding** - RGTAN will treat encoded categoricals as numerical features

## How It Works Now

### With Preprocessed Data:
```
- Loads creditcard_preprocessed.csv
- Uses scaled numerical features (ending with '_scaled')
- Uses encoded categorical features (ending with '_encoded')
- cat_features = [] (empty, no separate embeddings needed)
```

### With Raw Data:
```
- Loads vod_creditcard.csv
- Encodes categorical features on the fly
- cat_features = ['trans_status_msg_id', 'site_tag_id', ...]
- RGTAN creates embeddings for these
```

## Key Changes Made:

1. **In load_rgtan_data() for creditcard**:
   - When using preprocessed data: `cat_features = []`
   - Encoded features are already in the feature matrix

2. **In rgtan_main()**:
   - Added handling for empty cat_features
   - Falls back to dummy indices if categorical columns not found

3. **In preprocessing**:
   - Saves both scaled numerical and encoded categorical features
   - All features are treated as numerical inputs to the model

## To Run:

```bash
# Step 1: Preprocess (if not done)
python feature_engineering/preprocess_creditcard.py

# Step 2: Run RGTAN
python main.py --method rgtan --creditcard
```

This approach simplifies the model by treating encoded categorical features as numerical inputs, which is appropriate since they're already transformed into meaningful integer representations.
